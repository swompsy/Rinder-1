# Rinder Project Software Engineering
Rinder is a navigation app designed to transform the commuting experience for users of public transportation. Our mission is to solve a common problem faced by countless commuters: the risk of missing their stop when they're tired or engrossed in other activities during the journey.

With Rinder, we've developed a user-friendly solution to ensure passengers arrive at their destination without the stress of constantly monitoring their progress. Our app allows users to set their destination and activate an intelligent alarm system. When their position is in close proximity to the chosen destination, Rinder will gently wake them up, ensuring they never miss their stop again.
